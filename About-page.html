           <center><i><p style="font-size: 25px;">The IT Department provides the information technology required for the fulfilment of CERN’s mission in an efficient and effective manner.

This includes data processing and storage, networks and support for the LHC and non-LHC experimental programme, as well as services for the accelerator complex and for the whole laboratory and its users.

    We also provide a ground for advanced research and development of new IT technologies, with partners from other research institutions and industry.</i></p>

        <h3 style="font-size:30px;"><u><b>Data Centre</b></u></h3>
        <center><i><p style="font-size: 25px;">
            The CERN Data Centre is the heart of CERN’s entire scientific, administrative, and computing infrastructure. All services, including email, scientific data management and videoconferencing use equipment based in the data centre. A remote extension of the CERN Data Centre is hosted at the Wigner Research Centre for Physics in Hungary, and it provides the extra computing power required to cover CERN’s increasing needs.

           <center><i><p style="font-size: 25px;">
               State-of-the-art network equipment and over 35 000 km of optical fibre provide the infrastructure that is essential for running the computing facilities and services of the laboratory as well as for transferring the colossal amount of LHC data to and from the data centre. The Wigner Data Centre in Hungary, 1200km away, increases the overall capacity, with three 100 Gb/s (gigabit per second) fibre optic lines linking the two sites.

        <h3 style="font-size:30px;"><u><b>Data Storage</b></u></h3>
           <center><i><p style="font-size: 25px;">
               The LHC experiments produce over 50 petabytes of data per year, plus there is around 25 petabytes produced per year for data from other (non-LHC) experiments at CERN. Archiving the vast quantities of data is an essential function at CERN. 

Magnetic tapes are used as the main long-term storage medium. Tape is actually a very sophisticated storage material and it can store huge volumes of data. Tape is inexpensive, compact, doesn't consume much electricity, and is durable for long-term storage.  With the data tsunami from the LHC, being able to quickly retrieve petabytes of stored data is essential for physicists to make ground-breaking discoveries.

We have many tape robots to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data. We also have kept all the data from other and previous experiments, although this only represents a small fraction of the total (eg. the LEP experiments is about 400 terabytes. Peanuts compared to today's hundreds of petabytes!).
Accessing data

Accessing tape data is relatively slow, about 1-3 minutes from tape being located, mounted, read and data sent. Often physicists need to access the latest data immediately, so it is also made available on disk servers, where access time is significantly faster.
